        The maximum age in days of the head commit of a branch, tag or pull request.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Branches, tags or pull requests older than this will be ignored if their head 
    	is older than this number of days.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The default is <strong>0</strong> which basically deactivates this feature.
    	If the value is changed to any positive number above <strong>0</strong>, 
    	branches, tags or pull requests older than the amount of days mentioned
    	will be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
    	As a basis of the time-restriction, the last modification timestamp of the head commit 
    	is used together with the current system time. If the current system time is 
    	2020-01-10 11:20 AM GMT and the maximum commit age is set to 3 days, only branches, 
    	tags or pull requests more recent than 2020-01-07 11:20 AM GMT (system time) will 
    	be built. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	If a new tag or branch is created with an old head commit, it is possible that the 
    	filtering mechanism will ignore this "new" branch or tag even though it just was 
    	created a few moments ago. This is due to the fact that git only tracks timestamps
    	of commits and not those of branches, tags or pull requests.
